## college homework

## Simple Recursion:
1. Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.
2. Write a recursive function to find the nth Fibonacci number.
3. Implement a recursive function to reverse a string.

## Tail Recursion:
4. Write a tail-recursive function to calculate the sum of an array of integers.
5. Implement a tail-recursive function to find the power of a number.

## Multiple Recursion Calls:
6. Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion.
7. Find all permutations of a string using recursive backtracking.

## Indirect Recursion:
8. Implement two functions that call each other to solve a problem (e.g., even and odd function).

## Memoization (Top-Down Dynamic Programming):
9. Solve the Fibonacci sequence problem using memoization to optimize recursive calls.
10. Use memoization to calculate the nth term of the Lucas sequence.

## Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming:

## Divide and Conquer:
15. Write a recursive algorithm for the merge sort sorting technique.
16. Implement a recursive algorithm to calculate the fast Fourier transform (FFT).

## Recursive Data Structures:
17. Create a binary search tree and implement recursive functions for insertion, deletion, and searching.
18. Write a recursive function to find the height of a binary tree.

## Recursive Algorithm Analysis:
19. Analyze the time and space complexity of a recursive algorithm you've implemented in one of the previous questions.
